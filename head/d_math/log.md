>I decided to write this log file to track progress on this project. I think it's been around 4

>The main goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of computer graphics math, as well
>as gain a better understanding of game development.

>I've gotten to a point in this project that I've started seeing results from the classes. Just 
>yesterday I got 4 points in the shape of a box to spin around the z-axis, after confirming the
>points ***did*** go around the z-axis with desmos (plotting each and every point down), I saw that
>the functions and classes did their job and got the points to move around the origin. I was very
>happy with that result. Of course thats only a rotation in one directions, on one axis. I still
>have a lot of work to do before I can start using this class with OpenGL. I'm also still studying
>math in general, so progress on this project will probably be slow... thats it.

>Nothing has been done since the last log was written, mainly because I took a break from this thing
>to work on understanding math a little more than I did when I started this project. I wanted to
>write this log to set a few goals, those will be put in a separate file within this folder.
>At the moment, I'm still working on my math understanding, but I'm pretty close to finishing this
>Elementary Algebra textbook, just going through some boring, probably not necessary stuff for what
>this project is, but I want to go through it. Thats is, all I wanted to do was update this log
>for future reference.
