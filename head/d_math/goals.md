Goals for "d_math" 3d math library
===

The main goals of this library that I'm working on is to facilitate the necessary
mathematical procedures and functions for operating on objects in 2d AND 3d space.
  
This (d_math) is just one part of a game engine that I want to get to eventually. But as of
now, I'm not ready for that. I've considered trying to make a game with another,
more refined game editor like Unreal, or Godot, and I'll probably do that AFTER
doing some more work on this math library.
